# Developer Documentation

> These docs are fetched from the private `scanipy/scanipy` repository during CI builds.

## Local Development

To fetch the real developer docs locally, run:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_pat node scripts/fetch-docs.mjs
```

You need a GitHub PAT with `repo` scope that has access to `scanipy/scanipy`.
